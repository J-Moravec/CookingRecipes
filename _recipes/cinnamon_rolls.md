I love cinnamon so I was looking for a recipe with a lot of it. Cinnamon rolls came to my mind, they seem to be quite popular in English-speaking countries. But I didn't like those recipes, especially with the white thing poured on it. Fortunately, I have found this Swedish recipe with cardamom and it quickly became my favourite pastry. You can do so much with this! I have switched cardamom with nutmeg and ginger and tried to make it with coconut milk instead of normal milk!

You can choose if you want to have them as individual pieces, this way they will be a bit dryer and harder, or if you want your rolls a bit soften, put them close together. This will trap some of the moisture.
