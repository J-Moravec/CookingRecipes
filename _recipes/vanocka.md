Vánočka is a traditional braided Christmas bread (from Vánoce - Christmas). I think English people would call this dough Brioche. It is soft, sweet and buttery (with only 100 of butter), flavoured with spices and raisins. There is also an unbraided variant called Mazanec which is made for Easter.

If you make one big vánočka, be careful with baking. When I baked it in my glass bakeware, it didn't bake properly and while the surface was nicely brown, the middle was still raw. You can save yourself some experimentation if you instead bake smaller vánočkas, as shown in the picture.
