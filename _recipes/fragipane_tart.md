Recipe I got from supermarket leaflet. I don't even know what fragipane means, but it is quick, easy, and my wife loves it.

### Ingredients:
* 1-2 sheets of sweet short pastry
* 100g softened butter
* 1/2 cup of sugar
* 1 cup of flour
* 1 cup of ground almonds (or almond meal)
* 2 eggs
* 2-3 cans of preserved apricots, plums or peaches
* vanilla essence
* (optional) jam and sliced almonds for decoration

### Directions:
* preheat the oven for 180 degrees
* make fragipane filling by creaming butter with suggar and vanilla, then add both eggs one at the time
* fold in flour and ground almonds
* prepare tart case by greasing it and/or lining it with baking paper, then line with pastry
* fill case with fragipane, and put preserved fruit on top
* bake for 35-40 minutes
* (optional) after tart cooled down, brush with jam and sprinkle sliced almonds

### Tips

* When using almond meal as opposed to ground almonds, reduce the amount a bit, or introduce a little bit more liquid, be it more butter, a bit of spread (more liquidy than butter), or a tiny bit of milk, otherwise your cake will be stodgy.
