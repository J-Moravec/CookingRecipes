For pasta, any kind of flour will do. You can use eggs, no eggs, oil or no oil. Be sure to reduce 


## Homemade Pasta

For pasta or noodles, any kind of flour will do. Traditionally, semolina is used as this will give pasta a slightly rougher surface to get all the sauce. But any kind of flour will do fine, a fine flour makes a more silky noodles. To bind the flour together, eggs are usually used. Egg whites are mostly water and proteins that bind the flour together. Yolks contain fat that gives the pasta richer flavour. Sometimes, a spoon of oil is also suggested to soften the dough. But it is fine to use water as well, after all, the equally famous East-Asian noodles are made just from white flour and water.

### Ingredients
Ingredients for one serving, increase as required:

* 100 grams of flour
* 1 eggs
* pinch of salt

### Directions
* Mix ingredients together. Often it is suggested to make a little "well" out of the flour and pour the eggs/liquid into it, but it doesn't really matter.
* Kneed the dough for 20 minutes. The dough should be on the dryer side and thus it will be quite hard.
* Let the dough rest for 20 minutes
* Roll the dough, fold it, roll again, repeat.
* Roll into required thickness and shape and cut it.
