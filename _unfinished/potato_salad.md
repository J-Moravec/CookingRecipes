### Ingredients

* 1 kg potatoes
* 3-4 medium size carrots
* 1 parsnip
* 1/2 medium size celery root
* 1 jar of pickles
* 1 can of sterilized pea

#### spice
* 1-2 bay leafs
* 5-8 of whole allspice
* 5-8 of whole black pepper
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1 spoon of sugar
* 3 spoons of vinegar
* mayonnaise to taste, alternatively you can change some (but not all) mayo for white yoghurt for a lighter, more diet, version. But you still need some oiliness from mayo to keep it together and round the taste of ingredients.
* pepper and salt as needed

#### decoration
* hard-boiled egg
* pickled capsicum (or some sweet red pepper)
* sterilized pea

### Directions

* Boil washed unpeeled potatoes and peel them once they cooled down a bit. Do not overboil them (since you would get mashed potatoes instead). If potatoes are of different size, take out the smaller one before the bigger ones are finished.
* Dice root veggie (carrot, parsnip, celery root) and boil them in salted water together with spices. Remove from water and let cool down.
* Dice pickles, dice potatoes, mix everything (potatoes, root veggie, pickles, pea), add mayo/yoghurt and salt and pepper as needed.
* Decorate with pea, sliced pickles, hard-boiled egg and pickled capsicum for a nice red color.
