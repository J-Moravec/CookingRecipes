## 4 Donut recipes

### Ingredients

#### Simple dougnuts
* 500 g flour
* 330 ml milk
* 30 g butter
* 30 g sugar
* 3 eggs (yolks)
* 30 g yeast
* pinch of salt


#### Fine dougnuts I
* 500 g flour
* 250 ml milk
* 50 g butter
* 50 g sugar
* 5 eggs (yolks), 1 egg white
* 50 g yeast
* pinch of salt

#### Fine doughnuts II
* 500 g flour
* 200 ml milk
* 80 g butter
* 80 g sugar
* 6 eggs (yolks)
* 40 g yeast
* pinch of salt

#### Vdolky (Bohemian unfilled donuts)
* 500 g flour
* 250 ml milk
* 50 g butter
* 50 g sugar
* 1 eggs
* 20 g yeast
* pinch of salt

#### All:
* grated lemon peel, vanilla, cinamon and other spices to taste
* seedless jam, nutella or custard for filling
* alternatively, top with jam and quark or just eat as sweet buns

### Directions:
* Prepare starter by adding yeast, spoon of sugar and flour into a warm milk. Leave for 5-10 minutes.
* Mix flour, salt, sugar, melted butter and eggs, add starter, mix well and knead for 10-20 minutes until the dough is smooth
* put in oiled bowl, cover and let rise for an hour
* roll with rolling pin on well-floured surface into 2 cm thickness and cut with glass, cup or round cookie cutter
* alternatively, roll into 1 cm thickness, cut, put jam on one piece and cover with another, connect sides well; some instructions suggest to cut again with a smaller glass/cookie cutter, but neither way I was able to make a solid piece without spilling the jam everywhere during baking
* move dougnuts into baking paper and let them rise for 30 minutes
* deep fry in covered pot/deep fryer for about 3 minutes, turn again and contune to fry uncovered, remove and place on paper napkin to absorb fat
* alternatively, oil/butter them well and bake in pre-heated oven on 160-180 celsia for about 10-20 minutes
* if you didn't fill them before, take a knife, make a small hole in the midle and use fill with your favorite filling

Personally, I am not fan of using so much oil to deep fry my donuts, so I am just baking them. The last recipe is the simplest and you can increase the sugar to 100 g to get a good sweet buns.
