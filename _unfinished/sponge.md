This is a review of several different recipes.

### Techniques

Before going over recipes, we should first discuss some general directions.

#### Egg whites
Whisking egg whites is the basic way how to give a cake airiness. With the advent of electric mixers, whisking egg whites is suddenly much easier and does not take 20 minutes any more. However, egg whites are still quite finicky. Here are some guidelines:

* Do not overmix your eggwhites, 5 minutes (until tough) should be enough. When the egg whites are ready, you should be able to turn over the bowl over your head without getting dirty.
* You can almost always use about 1/3 of the sugar in recipe and create a tougher sugar-egg-white mix. Either add the sugar slowly spoon by spoon while you are whisking the eggs or add them after you have whisked your egg whites. This mix is much tougher which helps keep the airiness.
* Never mix your egg whites into the rest of the batter with mixer. Use spatula and work it in carefuly.
* If you add a pinch of salt, you will get tougher egg whites faster.


#### Egg yolks
Similarly, you can build in additional air by creaming egg yolks with sugar. Egg yolks are almost exclusively fat, while egg whites are protein with high water content, so the property of those two mixes will not be the same, but you can still build some airiness into the egg yolks.

#### Flour, cocoa and baking powder
* Flour is always mixed in the end carefully with a spatula, never with a mixer
* You can sieve your flour, this will add some airiness and prevent creation of crumbs that are hard to mix
* For chocolate flavoured sponge, replace some of the flour (try 1/5) with the same amount of cocoa powder.
* Baking powder shouldn't be required if you follow all the egg tricks as this should add enough airiness into the cake mix.

#### Bake time
Baking temperature and time is quite variable. It depends if you are making a higher cake form or shallow sponge for tiramisu or cake roll. It also depends if you are baking in metal form or glass, as glass bakes faster.

You can also increase temperature to promote caramelization (and decrease baking time). The effect of increased temperature is nicely described in [this](https://thecakeblog.com/2015/04/baking-temperature-comparison.html) article.

**You can use these two guidelines:**

* 150째C for 40 minutes
* 170째C for 20 minutes

Decrease baking time for shallow cakes and glass forms. Make sure you are baking equally from both sides (top and bottom). If cake is browning too quickly at the top, cover it with baking paper.

**Always:**

* constantly check your cake, but do not open the oven door, you will ruin the temperature
* when color is starting to look nice, check the readiness of the sponge with wooden stick (toothpick, wooden skewer), if there is the cake does not stick to the sponge when you pierce it, it should be ready

#### Oil or no oil?
Without oil, the cake is quite dry. This is ideal if you are using the sponge for cake roll, tiramisu, sour cream cake or other such cakes where the cake will absorb the moisture from cream, but it might be a bit too much for a standard cake.

A bit of oil will make cake more moist, cakey and bouncy. You do not need to add any additional flour or sugar.

#### Ingredients ratio
Without oil, the standard ratio for eggs, sugar and flour is 1/1/1.

* 1 egg
* 1 spoon of sugar
* 1 spoon of flour
* + pinch of salt

Spoon here stands for high/full tablespoon, not a flat one, or more precisely, 30 grams. So:

* 1 egg
* 30 g of sugar
* 30 g of flour
* + pinch of salt

With oil, the ratio is simple as well. Just add another 1 for 1/1/1/1. Given that you can't have high tablespoon of oil, in this case, it is about 10 grams or about 10 ml:


* 1 egg
* 30 g of sugar
* 30 g of flour
* 10 g of oil

## Recipes:

### Basic sponge:
Let's start with the most basic recipe. Enough for a standard metal cake form:

#### Ingredients

* *optional* sieve flour
* Cream yolks with about 2/3 (100g) of sugar
* Whip egg whites with a pinch of salt and when halfway done, slowly add the rest of the sugar under constant mixing
* using spatula, carefully mix egg whites and add yolks
* using spatula, spoon by spoon mix the flour into the eggs
* bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes at 150째C

If you want to roll the cake, move it still warm into a moist tea-towel or dry tea towel sprinkled with sugar.

### Oil cocoa sponge
