* mix flour with baking powder, you can sieve the flour to make it a bit more airy
* carefully, spoon by spoon, add flour and oil
* finally mix in carefully beaten egg whites
* pour into prepared form (butter/oil + flour, good baking paper)
* bake in pre-heated oven at 150-160 C for 40-50 minutes
* when done, pierce with thin wooden/metal stuck (such as skewers) to see if the dough is baked inside and to let air out
